# Linux Hive: Home Passive-Income Server

**Introduction**  
Why just have a server when it can *earn* for you? **Linux Hive** turns a home-based Linux server into a passive-income machine. By running **Honeygain** in Docker containers, the system shares unused internet bandwidth, earning JMPT tokens that can be converted to PHP.  

This project isn’t just about making money—it’s a **hands-on playground for mastering Linux, Docker, and server management**, all while your home setup quietly works in the background. Efficiency, tech skills, and passive income—**all in one box**.
